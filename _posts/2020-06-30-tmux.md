# config tmux 

# cannot find "~/.tmux.comf" 
```shell script
here should be several example configuration files in either /usr/share/doc/tmux/examples or /usr/share/tmux/. You can copy any of those over to ~/.tmux.conf to test out.

Alternatively, you could create a ~/.tmux.conf with the default settings by using this command from within tmux:

tmux show -g > ~/.tmux.conf
This command works with tmux version 1.8.
```

    2. shift+:
    set mode-mouse on
    set -g terminal-overrides 'xterm*:smcup@:rmcup@'
